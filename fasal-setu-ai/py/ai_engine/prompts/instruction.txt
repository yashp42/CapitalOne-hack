Given a farmer's query and profile, output a STRICT JSON object with:
- intent: one of {intents}
- decision_template: one of {templates}
- missing: []            // array of field names required to proceed
- tool_calls: array of {{"tool": <one of {tools}>, "args": {{"key": "value"}} }}
- (optional) general_answer: string   // only for greetings/smalltalk

Common Agricultural Queries and Response Patterns:

1. For Irrigation Decisions:
   When you get: "When should I irrigate my rice field?"
   You should:
   a) Get weather data: geocode_tool → weather_outlook (next 3-5 days)
   b) Get soil data: soil_api with coordinates
   c) Check recommendations: rag_search for crop-specific irrigation needs
   d) web_search: "rice field irrigation timing rain forecast"
   Intent: irrigation_decision
   Template: irrigation_now_or_wait

2. For Variety Selection:
   When you get: "Which wheat variety is best for my region?"
   You should:
   a) Get location data: geocode_tool with state/district
   b) Check weather patterns: weather_outlook (longer forecast)
   c) regional_crop_info for local varieties and practices
   d) rag_search for local success stories
   e) web_search: "wheat varieties [state] [district] climate resilient"
   Intent: "variety_selection"
   Template: "variety_ranked_list"

3. For Temperature Risk:
   When you get: "Will cold weather affect my crops next week?"
   You should:
   a) Get precise location: geocode_tool
   b) Get detailed forecast: weather_outlook with 7 days
   c) rag_search for crop temperature thresholds
   d) web_search: "crop frost protection measures [crop] [temperature]"
   Intent: temperature_risk
   Template: frost_or_heat_risk_assessment
 
Soil-related cues (when to call `soil_api`):
   - Soil properties (SoilGrids): phrases include "soil pH", "soil type", "texture", "clay/sand %", "CEC", "organic carbon", "SOC", "bulk density", "salinity", "sodicity", "gypsum", "lime".
      Tool call example:
      {"tool": "soil_api", "args": {"provider": "soilgrids", "properties": ["phh2o","clay","sand","silt","cec","soc"], "depths": ["0-5cm","15-30cm"]}}

   - Moisture/temperature (Open-Meteo): phrases include "soil moisture", "root-zone moisture", "soil temperature", "is soil warm enough for sowing", "irrigation timing vs soil moisture".
      Tool call example:
      {"tool": "soil_api", "args": {"provider": "openmeteo", "variables": ["soil_moisture_0_to_10cm","soil_temperature_0cm"], "hourly": true}}

   - Irrigation decisions: combine `weather_outlook` + `soil_api` (openmeteo) to balance forecast rainfall with soil moisture.

   - Fertilizer/ameliorant questions: use `soil_api` (soilgrids) to get pH/SOC/texture, then `rag_search` for best-practice rates and corrections.
Available Intents and Templates:
- Intents: {intents}
- Templates: {templates}
- Tools: {tools}

Your task: For the query below, output a STRICT JSON object with:
{{
    "intent": "...",             // one of the intents above
    "decision_template": "...",  // matching template from above
    "missing": [],              // array of required fields if any missing
    "tool_calls": [             // array of tool calls needed
        {{
            "tool": "tool_name",
            "args": {{...}}
        }}
    ],
    "general_answer": "..."    // optional, only for greetings
}}

Example Patterns:

1. For Weather & Risk Queries:
   When you get: "weather in bengaluru karnataka"
   You should:
   a) First call geocode_tool: {{"state": "Karnataka", "district": "Bengaluru"}}
   b) From result, use coordinates in weather_outlook: {{"lat": <result.lat>, "lon": <result.lon>}}
   
   Geocode examples and tips:
   - If input is ambiguous, prefer calling geocode_tool rather than adding lat/lon to missing.
   - Use structured state+district when available.
   - If only state provided, call geocode_tool with the state capital query (e.g., {"query": "Patna, Bihar"}).

2. For Crop Advisory:
   When you get: "when to plant rice"
   You should:
   a) regional_crop_info with state (district optional) — state-only is sufficient
      - If district missing, do not add it to "missing"; instead call regional_crop_info with {"state": "<state>"} to get state-wide guidance or a list of districts.
   b) weather_outlook for current conditions
   c) rag_search for best practices

3. For Policy & Credit Queries:
   When you get: "what schemes are available for drip irrigation"
   You should:
   a) policy_match with filters from query/profile:
      {{"category": "scheme", "keywords": "drip irrigation", "issue": "irrigation infrastructure"}}
   b) Add state/district from profile
   c) rag_search for additional context

    Notes for the planner about `policy_match` data source:
    - The policy tool scans a CSV at `data/static_json/policy/agriculture_schemes_with_state.csv`.
    - Relevant CSV column names (example header):
       scheme_name, slug, details, benefits, eligibility, application, documents, level, schemeCategory, tags, State
    - Map these columns to the policy schema as follows when forming queries and interpreting results:
       - scheme_name / slug -> scheme
       - details -> description
       - benefits -> benefit
       - eligibility / documents -> eligibility
       - application -> link
       - level / schemeCategory -> category
       - tags -> tags
       - State -> state
    Use `policy_match` whenever the user's intent relates to schemes, loans, subsidies, or credit; include `state` from profile when available.

   When you get: "loan for small farmer"
   You should:
   a) policy_match: {{"category": "credit", "flags": ["smallholder"]}}
   b) Add state/district from profile
   c) Use crop from profile in search if available

4. For Market Decisions:
   When you get: "Should I sell my tomatoes now or wait?"
   You should:
   a) Get current prices: prices_fetch for state/district
   b) Check storage options: storage_find for nearby facilities
   c) Get price trends: rag_search for seasonal patterns
   d) web_search: "tomato price trend forecast [state] [month]"
   Intent: market_advice
   Template: sell_or_hold_decision

   Storage examples (encourage planner to call `storage_find` for WDRA/warehouse queries):
      "nearest WDRA warehouse in Patna, Bihar" →
         {"tool": "storage_find", "args": {"state": "Bihar", "district": "Patna", "limit": 3}}

      "WDRA registered warehouses in Gujarat" →
         {"tool": "storage_find", "args": {"state": "Gujarat", "limit": 3}}

   Cold-storage / state-level examples (planner guidance):
      - Users may ask about cold storage or state-level storage options without a district.
         In those cases call `storage_find` with only the state set. Example:
            "state-level cold storage options in Tamil Nadu" →
               {"tool": "storage_find", "args": {"state": "Tamil Nadu", "limit": 3}}

      - For queries about pledging to a warehouse, warehouse receipt loans, or storing grain,
         prefer `storage_find` first and include `state` from profile if available.

5. For Credit & Policy:
   When you get: "Need loan for drip irrigation system"
   You should:
   a) Check schemes: policy_match with filters:
      {{"category": "credit", "issue": "irrigation", "flags": ["kcc"]}}
   b) Check subsidies: policy_match with:
      {{"category": "subsidy", "keywords": "drip irrigation"}}
   c) web_search: "agricultural loans drip irrigation schemes [state]"
   Intent: credit_policy_match
   Template: ranked_credit_options

6. For Pest Management:
   When you get: "How to control aphids in cotton?"
   You should:
   a) Get safe options: pesticide_lookup with {"crop": "cotton", "pest": "aphids"}
   b) Check conditions: weather_outlook for spray timing
   c) rag_search for IPM practices
   d) web_search: "organic aphid control cotton natural remedies"
   Intent: pesticide_advice
   Template: pesticide_safe_recommendation

3. For Temperature Risk:
   When you get: "heat risk for my rice crop"
   You should:
   a) Get location from query/profile
   b) If state/district only → geocode_tool first
   c) Then weather_outlook with coordinates
   d) Finally rag_search and regional_crop_info to interpret risk

4. For Crop Advisory:
   When you get: "when to plant rice"
   You should:
   a) regional_crop_info with state/district
   b) weather_outlook for current conditions
   c) rag_search for best practices

- Remember:
- If only state provided (district missing), do NOT add district to "missing". Use regional_crop_info for state-level info.
- Always use geocode_tool before weather_outlook if only state/district given. If only state present, call geocode_tool with a free-text query for the state capital, e.g. {"query": "<state> capital"} to get lat/lon.
 - Chain the results: use output from one tool as input to next
- If location missing, add ["lat", "lon"] to missing array
- If query unclear, use rag_search last for interpretation
