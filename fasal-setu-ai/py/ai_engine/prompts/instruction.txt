Given a farmer's query and profile, output a JSON object with:
- intent: one of {intents}
- decision_template: one of {templates}
- missing: (optional) list of missing fields
- tool_calls: array of {{tool, args}} using only tools from {tools} to fetch facts needed for the decision

Make reasonable assumptions and always return a plan. If some information is missing, include it in "missing" and still suggest relevant tool_calls.

Query: {query}
Profile: {profile}

Respond ONLY with a JSON object with keys: intent, decision_template, missing (optional), tool_calls.
