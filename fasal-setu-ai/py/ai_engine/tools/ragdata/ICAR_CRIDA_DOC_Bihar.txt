1.1 Agro-Climatic/Ecological Zone Satpura range and Wainganga Valley, hot moist subhumid ESR with shallow to deep loamy to clayey mixed Red and Black soils, low to medium AWC and LGP 180-210 days. 1.7 Area under major field crops Kharif/Rabi/Summer: Paddy 190.9ha, Soybean 9.2ha, Pigeonpea 4.2ha, Wheat 3.7ha, Gram 2.6ha, Sesame 1.0ha. Sowing window: Paddy Nursery 15June–10July, Soybean 15June–15July, Pigeon pea 15June–7July, Linseed & Gram 1–15Oct, Rabi crops 15Oct–25Oct. Early season drought (delayed onset): Delay by 2–8 weeks with crop adjustments; preferred paddy varieties SKL-6, PKV Makrand, PKV Ganesh, PKV HMT, SYE2001, protective irrigation and life-saving irrigation during dry spells, recommended pest/disease controls. Mid-season drought: At vegetative stage, life saving irrigation, nitrogen fertilizer at sufficient moisture, interculture, rain water harvesting. Crops: Paddy (Bandhi system), Soybean (JS-335, TAMS98-21), Pigeon pea (AKT-8811, Vipula, PKV-Tara). Terminal drought: Early withdrawal of monsoon, protective irrigation, reduce paddy area; Rabi crops: Chickpea, Lathyrus, Linseed, vegetables, irrigate at critical stages. Unusual rains: Continuous high rainfall causes water logging, drain excess water at vegetative and flowering stages, delay harvesting, salt treatment of wetted paddy seed, pest outbreak treated by Monocrotophos and Cypermethrin sprays.

1.1 Agro-climatic zone Eastern Vidarbha zone, hot sub-humid, dry; soils deep black (~79%), medium black (~8%), shallow black (~13%). Main Kharif crops: Paddy (~205,000ha), pigeon pea, sesame. Sowing windows: Kharif paddy (rainfed) early July, irrigated early June, Gram/Wheat mid-Nov to mid-Dec. Drought contingencies: Delayed onset 2–8 weeks—short/medium duration paddy varieties PKV-HMT, SYE-2001, MTU-1010; use community nurseries; mulching in pigeon pea/sesame; relay cropping lathyrus/gram; life saving irrigation for paddy; apply pest/disease chemical sprays. Flood/excess rain: Ensure field drainage, harvest at maturity, salt water treatment of paddy seed, pest control with Monocrotophos, Cypermethrin for paddy and pulses.

Odisha rice advisories (summarized from prior): Kharif rice in coastal districts; medium-duration (125days) and long-duration (150days) paddy; agro-climatic hot humid, soils lateritic, alluvial, saline; growing period ~168–266days, cropping intensity 163–205%. Sowing windows: Medium-duration rice, SMW 25–42 (late June to mid-Oct); long-duration rice, SMW 26–49 (late June to early Dec). Favourable conditions: Tmax 30–34°C at sowing, Tmin 26–28°C to 21–24°C by maturity, rainfall 78–110mm/week at transplanting. Soils: Upland needs drought/blast tolerant types (Sahabhagi, Khandagiri, MTU-1010); medium land, 120–140days, varieties like MTU1156, CRDhan310, Sampada, Lalat; lowland >140days, Swarna, Pooja, Durga, Pratikshya. Crop management: Seed treatment with fungicide, wet/dry nursery, spacing 20×15cm, fertilizer as per soil, weed management with pre-emergence Pretilachlor/Oxadiargyl, beushaning (post-emergence weeding) and urea top-dressing; pest/disease management uses chemical sprays for stem borer, leaf folder, WBPH, and case worm; fungicides for blast, BLB, sheath rot as per weather
