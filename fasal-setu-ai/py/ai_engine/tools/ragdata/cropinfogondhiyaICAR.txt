. District Level Crop Weather Calendars and Advisories for Kharif Rice in Odisha
Scope: Developed for medium-duration (125 days) and long-duration (150 days) paddy varieties for coastal Odisha districts: Khordha, Puri, Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur.

Agro-climatic characteristics: Hot and humid climate with lateritic, alluvial, and saline soils.

Length of growing period: ~168 to 266 days depending on district; cropping intensity ranges 163–205%.

Climate normals used: 30 years data (1993–2023) of Tmax, Tmin, RH, rainfall, sunshine hours, wind speed, evaporation.

SMW season window:

Medium duration rice: SMW 25–42 (Late June to mid-Oct).

Long duration rice: SMW 26–49 (Late June to early Dec).

Favourable weather conditions for high yield:

Tmax: 30–34°C (sowing) dropping to ~30–32°C (grain filling)

Tmin: ~26–28°C at sowing → ~21–24°C at maturity.

Rainfall: ~78–110 mm/week at transplanting.

RH: 80–90% during flowering.

Water requirements: Stage-wise PET × crop coefficient; ~250–300 mm at sowing, ~500–550 mm at tillering, dropping to ~50–100 mm at maturity.

Pest and disease congenial weather:

Stem borer, leaf folder, BPH/WBPH: Temp 20–30°C, RH >70%, wind <5 km/h, 0–50 mm rain.

Blast, BLB: Temp 20–30°C, RH >90%, 30–50 mm rain, wind <5 km/h.

Sheath blight, brown spot have similar high humidity requirements.

Phenophases:

Sowing & seedling: 25–28 SMW (Medium); 26–29 SMW (Long)

Transplanting: 29–31 (Medium); 30–32 (Long)

Tillering–Panicle: 32–34 (Medium); 33–39 (Long)

Flowering: 35–38 (Medium); 40–43 (Long)

Grain filling–Maturity: 39–42 (Medium); 44–49 (Long)

Varieties suggested:

Upland (100–120 days): Short-duration drought/blast tolerant types (e.g., Sahabhagi, Khandagiri, MTU-1010).

Medium land (120–140 days): MTU 1156, CR Dhan 310, Sampada, Lalat, Nua acharmati.

Lowland (>140 days): Swarna, Pooja, Durga, Pratikshya, etc.

Cultural practices:

Seed treatment with fungicides before sowing

Wet or dry nursery preparation; recommended spacing 20 × 15 cm; basal fertilizer dose (DAP + MOP + urea) depending on soil.

Weed management with pre-emergence Pretilachlor/Oxadiargyl or post-emergence Bispyribac sodium.

Beushaning after 25–30 days in unweeded fields, followed by urea top-dress.

Pest & disease management:

Chemical sprays for stem borer, leaf folder, WBPH, and case worm based on early detection.

Fungicidal sprays for blast, BLB, sheath rot, foot rot depending on weather conditions.

2. Agriculture Contingency Plan – Gondia District (Maharashtra)
Agro-climatic zone: Eastern Vidarbha zone; hot sub-humid, dry; ~1378 mm annual rainfall over ~60 days.

Soils: Deep black (~79%), medium black (~8%), shallow black (~13%).

Net sown area: ~183,000 ha; ~54% irrigated (mainly canals).

Main Kharif crops: Paddy (~205,000 ha total), pigeon pea, sesame.

Rabi crops: Wheat, gram, linseed.

Sowing windows:

Kharif paddy (rainfed): Early July; irrigated: Early June.

Gram, wheat: mid-November to mid-December.

Major weather risks: Drought (regular), flood (occasional), pest & disease outbreaks.

Drought contingency (rainfed):

Delayed onset up to 2–4 weeks: Use medium & short-duration paddy varieties, re-sow with higher seed rate, use community nurseries.

Delay 6–8 weeks: Switch to short-duration paddy, pigeon pea on bunds, or alternate crops like sesame, sunflower, mustard, maize, gram in Rabi.

Mid-season drought: Mulching in pigeon pea/sesame, relay cropping of Lathyrus/Gram in standing paddy.

Terminal drought: Life-saving irrigation to paddy in October; relay Gram, Lathyrus, mustard; harvest paddy for fodder if crop failure imminent.

Flood/Excess rain contingency:

Ensure drainage; harvest at physiological maturity; salt water treatment of wet paddy seed; relocate produce to safe storage.

Pest/disease treatments for paddy (Monocrotophos, Cypermethrin), pulse pod borers, gram caterpillars.

3. Agriculture Contingency Plan – Bhandara District (Maharashtra)
Agro-climatic zone: Eastern Vidarbha Zone, hot moist sub-humid; ~1361 mm rainfall over ~60 days.

Soils: Mostly deep soils (79%), with shallow (13%) and medium-deep (8%) mixed red and black soils.

Net sown area: ~178,000 ha; 60% irrigated (mainly canals).

Main Kharif crops: Paddy (~191,000 ha), soybean (~9,200 ha), pigeonpea (~4,200 ha), sesame (~1,000 ha).

Rabi crops: Wheat, gram, linseed.

Sowing windows:

Rainfed paddy: mid-June–early July; irrigated: early June.

Soybean/pigeonpea: mid-June–early July.

Rabi linseed & gram: October.

Drought contingencies:

Delayed onset: Mid-duration paddy, direct seeding with drum seeder, early soybean varieties, pigeonpea on bunds.

Severe delay (6–8 weeks): Short-duration paddy, early soybean, or switch to semi-rabi sesame, sunflower, pigeonpea-lathyrus intercrops
Mid-season drought: Protective irrigation, nitrogen topdressing at adequate moisture, interculture, furrow opening for rainwater harvesting.
Terminal drought: Supplemental irrigation in September; plan rabi crops like gram, linseed, lathyrus.
Flood/Excess rain contingency:
Field drainage, delayed harvest, salt treatment of wet paddy seed, safe storage of produce.
Pest/disease interventions similar to Gondia (Monocrotophos, Cypermethrin for paddy insects; neem extract, HANPV for pod borers).
