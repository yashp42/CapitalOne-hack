ORGANIC FARMING – PRACTICAL STARTER GUIDE (India context)

Principles of Organic Farming
Organic farming is a holistic production management system which promotes and enhances agro-ecosystem health, including biodiversity, biological cycles and soil biological activity. It emphasises the use of management practices in preference to the use of off-farm inputs. Where possible, organic farming systems rely on crop rotations, crop residues, animal manures, green manures, off-farm organic wastes, mineral-bearing rocks and aspects of biological pest control to maintain soil productivity and supply plant nutrients. Organic agriculture combines tradition, innovation and science to benefit the environment and promote fair relationships and a good quality of life for all involved.

Certification in India
In India, organic certification is carried out under two main systems: the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) and the Participatory Guarantee System (PGS-India). NPOP, under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and implemented through APEDA, is required for exports and major domestic supply chains. It requires inspection by accredited certification bodies, annual audits, maintenance of farm records, and adherence to national organic standards. PGS-India is a community-based certification system supported by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare through NCOF. It relies on mutual trust, peer reviews, and knowledge exchange among small farmers. Both systems prohibit GMOs, synthetic fertilisers and pesticides, and ensure complete traceability of organic produce. [Source: APEDA & NCOF Guidelines]

Conversion Period and Planning
The conversion period from conventional to organic farming generally takes two to three years depending on land history. During this period, synthetic inputs must be completely stopped and the soil gradually rehabilitated using compost, green manures, and other organic amendments. Farmers are advised to map their fields, maintain buffer zones to protect against contamination from neighbouring non-organic farms, and design multi-year crop rotations. The first year often emphasises building soil fertility through legumes and green manure crops such as dhaincha, sunnhemp or cowpea. In the second year, more demanding crops like cereals and vegetables may be introduced, followed by certified organic status in the third year if inspections are satisfactory.

Soil Fertility Management
Maintaining soil fertility in organic farming is primarily achieved through the addition of organic matter and the stimulation of biological soil activity. Composting crop residues, farmyard manure, and kitchen waste creates stable humus that enhances cation exchange capacity, moisture retention, and nutrient availability. Biofertilisers like Rhizobium, Azotobacter, Azospirillum, and phosphate solubilising bacteria (PSB) inoculants improve nitrogen fixation and phosphorus availability. Regular soil testing is advised, but organic nutrient management relies more on biological indicators such as earthworm activity, soil aggregation, and crop response. Green manures and cover crops contribute nitrogen and organic carbon, while crop rotations balance nutrient extraction and return. [Source: FAO Organic Training Manual]

Weed Management
Weed control in organic farming depends on preventive and cultural practices. These include timely sowing, maintaining optimum plant populations, mulching, stale seedbed techniques, intercropping, and crop rotation. Mechanical weeding with hoes, harrows, and weeders is common, while mulching with crop residues or plastic reduces weed emergence. In perennial systems, grazing animals may also contribute to weed suppression. Biological control of weeds is less common, but some success has been observed with pathogenic fungi and insects. The emphasis is always on maintaining crop vigour and competitive canopies rather than attempting complete weed eradication.

Pest and Disease Management
Organic farming follows the principle of Integrated Pest Management (IPM), prioritising prevention over cure. Key measures include using resistant varieties, healthy seeds, crop rotations, habitat management for natural enemies, and timely sowing. When pest incidence crosses economic thresholds, permitted biological and botanical inputs may be used. These include neem-based products, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV), Trichoderma for fungal diseases, and pheromone or sticky traps. Copper compounds and sulphur are sometimes permitted in limited quantities. All treatments must be recorded, and the waiting period before harvest strictly respected to maintain organic integrity.

Water and Irrigation in Organic Systems
Water management in organic farming relies on soil organic matter to increase water holding capacity and mulching to reduce evaporation. Micro-irrigation systems such as drip and sprinkler reduce disease incidence compared to flood irrigation. Rainwater harvesting, farm ponds, and contour bunds are encouraged to ensure sustainable water availability. Excess irrigation is avoided since it promotes nutrient leaching and fungal disease outbreaks. Farmers are advised to synchronise irrigation schedules with critical crop stages like flowering and grain filling.

Livestock in Organic Farming
Livestock play a central role in nutrient cycling in organic systems. Cattle, goats, and poultry provide manure, urine, and draught power, while crop residues feed the animals. Manure must be composted before application to kill pathogens and stabilise nutrients. In India, cow-based formulations such as Panchagavya and Jeevamrutha are widely promoted in organic circles, combining cow dung, urine, milk, curd, and ghee with other ingredients to stimulate microbial activity and plant health. Livestock must be maintained under organic management, with organic feed and adequate space.

Record Keeping and Internal Control
Farmers must keep detailed farm diaries including sowing dates, inputs used, pest and disease observations, and harvest data. For group certification under PGS, Internal Control Systems (ICS) are set up where farmer groups audit each other, supported by NCOF. Records ensure traceability, compliance, and continuous improvement. Proper documentation is essential for maintaining organic status and accessing premium markets.

Marketing of Organic Produce
Marketing channels for organic produce in India include direct farmer markets, organic bazaars, retail chains, and export markets. Labelling is strictly regulated: the “India Organic” mark is used under NPOP certification, while “PGS-Green” and “PGS-Organic” labels apply under PGS-India depending on the stage of conversion. Farmers must maintain integrity in transport, storage, and sale, avoiding contamination or mixing with conventional produce. Certification agencies issue transaction certificates for each consignment, especially for exports to the EU, US, and other regulated markets.
