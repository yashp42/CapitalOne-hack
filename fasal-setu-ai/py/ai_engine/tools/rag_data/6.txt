POST-HARVEST AND STORAGE MANAGEMENT – DETAILED REFERENCE

Importance of Post-Harvest
Up to 30% of agricultural produce in India is lost post-harvest due to poor handling, storage, and pests. Post-harvest management extends shelf life, maintains quality, and ensures farmer profitability. [Source: ICAR-CIPHET, FAO Post-Harvest Manuals]

Grain Storage
- Traditional methods: underground pits, mud bins, bamboo structures.  
- Improved methods: Pusa bin, metal silos, hermetic bags.  
- Scientific principles: dry grain to 12–14% moisture, clean before storage, protect from insects and rodents, maintain aeration.  
- Insect control: fumigation with aluminium phosphide (strictly by trained operators), use of inert dusts (diatomaceous earth) in organic systems.  
- Rodent control: traps, bait stations, sanitation.

Horticultural Produce Storage
- Fruits and vegetables are highly perishable; losses are 20–25% without cold chain.  
- Precooling (forced-air or hydrocooling) immediately after harvest removes field heat.  
- Cold storage: potatoes stored at 2–4°C, onions at 0–1°C with 65–70% RH, apples at 0–1°C with controlled atmosphere.  
- Packaging: ventilated crates, corrugated fiberboard boxes, cushioning with paper/straw.  
- Transportation: reefer vans, evaporative cool chambers for local markets.

Onion and Potato Storage
- Onion: traditionally stored in naturally ventilated structures (bamboo/thatched roof). Improved storage structures (raised platforms, slatted walls) reduce rotting and sprouting by 20–30%.  
- Potato: cold stores at 2–4°C and 90–95% RH prevent sprouting and shrinkage. For seed potatoes, 3–4°C storage with diffused light is recommended.

Value Addition and Processing
- Cereals: milling, parboiling, flaking.  
- Pulses: dal milling, packaging in moisture-proof bags.  
- Oilseeds: cold pressing, refining.  
- Fruits: juice, jam, jelly, pickles, dehydration.  
- Vegetables: dehydration, canning, freezing.  
- Spices: cleaning, grading, grinding, essential oil extraction.  
Processing increases farmer income, reduces wastage, and opens export markets.

Warehouse Infrastructure in India
- WDRA regulates registered warehouses eligible for negotiable warehouse receipts (eNWR).  
- Farmers can deposit produce and access credit against eNWR.  
- NABARD and AIF schemes support warehouse construction.  
- Cold chain development by NHB and private players is expanding rapidly.

Good Practices for Post-Harvest
- Harvest at maturity indices (e.g., colour change, dry matter content).  
- Use clean, sharp tools to avoid mechanical injury.  
- Handle gently to avoid bruises and cuts.  
- Maintain hygiene in storage and transport.  
- Keep records of storage conditions, fumigation, and produce movement.
