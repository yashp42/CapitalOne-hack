INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM) – DETAILED REFERENCE

Principles of IPM
Integrated Pest Management is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-term prevention of pests and their damage. The approach combines biological, cultural, mechanical, physical, and chemical tools in a coordinated manner. The goal is not eradication of pests but maintaining populations below economic threshold levels (ETL). IPM reduces pesticide residues, delays resistance, and preserves ecological balance.

Core Components of IPM
1. Prevention – Use resistant varieties, clean seed, crop rotation, balanced fertilisation, and proper water management.  
2. Monitoring – Regular scouting of fields, installing pheromone and sticky traps, maintaining pest incidence records.  
3. Decision-making – Use Economic Threshold Levels (ETL) as benchmarks for interventions.  
4. Intervention – Prefer biological and cultural methods; chemicals are last resort.  
5. Evaluation – Assess effectiveness and adjust practices.

Case Studies

Rice IPM
- Key pests: stem borer, leaf folder, gall midge, brown planthopper, blast disease.  
- Cultural: synchronous planting, optimum spacing, maintaining field sanitation.  
- Mechanical: light traps for stem borer moths, removal of infected tillers.  
- Biological: release of Trichogramma japonicum against stem borers, use of fungal pathogens like Metarhizium.  
- Botanical: neem seed kernel extract sprays at 5%.  
- ETL: 10% deadhearts or 2 egg masses per m² for stem borer.

Wheat IPM
- Key pests: aphids, termites; diseases: rusts (yellow, brown, black).  
- Cultural: early sowing to escape rusts, balanced NPK, removal of volunteer plants.  
- Mechanical: seed treatment with Trichoderma; deep ploughing to kill termites.  
- Biological: release of Chrysoperla larvae to control aphids.  
- ETL: 15–20 aphids per tiller in early growth stages.

Cotton IPM
- Key pests: bollworms, jassids, whiteflies, mealybugs.  
- Cultural: use of Bt cotton hybrids, intercropping with sorghum as trap crops, timely sowing.  
- Mechanical: pheromone traps for bollworms, yellow sticky traps for whiteflies.  
- Biological: Trichogramma, Chrysoperla, ladybird beetles.  
- Botanical: neem-based sprays.  
- ETL: 10% infested fruiting bodies for bollworms.

Vegetable IPM (Tomato, Chilli, Brinjal)
- Pests: fruit borers, aphids, mites, shoot borers.  
- Cultural: crop rotation, staking tomatoes, resistant varieties.  
- Biological: NPV for Helicoverpa, Trichogramma for eggs, predatory mites against spider mites.  
- Mechanical: pheromone traps, removal of infested shoots.  
- Botanical: neem oil sprays.  
- Diseases: damping off controlled by Trichoderma seed treatment + soil solarisation.

Benefits of IPM
- Reduces cost of cultivation by lowering pesticide use.  
- Minimises pesticide residues, improving food safety.  
- Conserves natural enemies and biodiversity.  
- Improves sustainability of production systems.
